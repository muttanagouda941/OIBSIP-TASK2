            in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s, while also averaging 49 in the three-match
            Test series.Following India Under-19's success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach
            Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his
            admiration for profound technical prowess<br><br>

            Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only
            eight List A matches under his belt. So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up"<br><br>
            <h3><b></b>Indian Premier League</b></h3>
            ☛ After a successful performance in the Under-19 World Cup, Kohli was signed by the Royal Challengers

            amassed <b>973 runs in 16 matches, averaging 81.08 runs per game.</b><br><br>
            ☛ This performance earned him the coveted
            <b>Orange Cap and the esteemed Most Valuable Player Award of the Vivo IPL 2016</b>.Kohli's campaign was
            marked by his remarkable innings, with four centuries to his name, a feat previously unaccomplished by him
            in the Twenty20 format.<br><br>
            ☛ In a match against Kings XI Punjab, he played a knock of 113*, which remained
            as his best performance of the season. In October 2016, Kohli announced at the launch event of his
            biography, <b><u> "Driven: The Virat Kohli Story" </u> </b>in New Delhi, that he would permanently play for
            Royal
            Challengers Bangalore, the franchise he had been captaining for several seasons.<br><br>

            and have made personal contributions towards wildlife relief efforts.<br><br>
            <h3>Persnol Life</h3>
